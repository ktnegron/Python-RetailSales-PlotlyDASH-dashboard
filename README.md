# Retail_Sales_PlotlyDASH_dashboard
This is an introduction to Plotly Dash using sales data from a UK online retailer. Data provided is for 2011 with the following features:

* InvoiceNo	
* StockCode	
* Description	
* Quantity	
* InvoiceDate	
* UnitPrice	
* CustomerID	
* Country

This code helps you navigate the basics of data manipulation in Pandas and visualization using Plotly & Dash components, by creating a snapshot of how sales are behaving, which will look like the images below. Feel free to modify the code to implement new visuals.

NOTE: the scope of the data is small (i.e. # of features) which limits the analysis. However, I prodive a simple clustering techinque using sklearn.cluster  & KMeans. See JupyterNotebook for this.
